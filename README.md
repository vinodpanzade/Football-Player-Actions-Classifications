# Football Player Actions Classification

## Description
This project focuses on classifying different football player actions using various machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest. Additionally, it incorporates image classification concepts like Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and image resizing to enhance the accuracy of classification.

## Features
- Utilizes machine learning algorithms: SVM, KNN, Random Forest.
- Incorporates image classification techniques: SIFT, image resizing.
- Provides classification of football player actions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (install via pip): numpy, scikit-learn, OpenCV

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/vinodpanzade/football-player-actions-classification.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset:
    - Ensure your dataset contains images of various football player actions labeled accordingly.
2. Preprocess images:
    - Use image resizing techniques provided in the code if needed.
    - Apply SIFT to extract relevant features from images.
3. Train models:
    - Run `train.py` to train SVM, KNN, and Random Forest models.
4. Evaluate models:
    - Use `evaluate.py` to evaluate the trained models on test data.
5. Classify football player actions:
    - Use `classify.py` to classify football player actions in new images.
